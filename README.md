# old-phone-pad

Here is an old phone keypad with alphabetical letters, a backspace key, and a send button. Each button has a number to identify it and pressing a button multiple times will cycle through the letters on it allowing each button to represent more than one letter. For example, pressing 2 once will return ‘A’ but pressing twice in succession will return ‘B’. You must pause for a second in order to type two characters from the same button after each other: “222 2 22” -> “CAB”.

Prompt:
Please design and document a class of method that will turn any input to OldPhonePad into the correct output. Assume that a send “#” will always be included at the end of every input.


Examples:
OldPhonePad(“33#”) => output: E
OldPhonePad(“227*#”) => output: B
OldPhonePad(“4433555 555666#”) => output: HELLO
OldPhonePad(“8 88777444666*664#”) => output: ?????
